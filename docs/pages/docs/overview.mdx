# Project Overview

This page gives a high-level view of the EDU Immosurance integration and what each API area is used for.

## Integration Model

- **AML** is the client platform.
- **EDU** is the learning platform server.
- Communication is **server-to-server** over HTTPS.

## Base URL

```
https://edu.immosurance.net
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require `api_key` as a query parameter.

Example:

```
GET /api/immosurance/users/exists?immosurance_user_id=user-123&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Main API Domains

### 1) Identity & Organization Sync

Used to create or update organizations and admin users from AML.

- Sync admin + organization
- Optionally link organization to an organization group

### 2) User Lifecycle

Used to manage user existence and access state.

- Check if user exists
- Deactivate/reactivate user
- Permanently delete user

### 3) Curriculum Management

Used to control curriculum availability and assignment behavior.

- List curricula for organization
- Set curriculum active/inactive
- Set curriculum user status (single user or all users)

### 4) Redirect Flows (Auto-Login)

Used to generate secure redirect URLs from AML to EDU.

- Start curriculum as user
- Redirect admin to curriculum creation
- Redirect admin to a specific curriculum page

### 5) Results & Reporting

Used to retrieve learning progress and completion status.

- Learning statuses
- User activity logs
- Curriculum audit logs

## Roles (High-Level)

- **Super Admin**: Full platform access.
- **Admin**: Organization-scoped management and reporting.
- **Organization Group Admin**: Manages semi-global content for linked organizations.
- **User**: Follows assigned curricula, trainings, and assessments.

## Typical End-to-End Flow

1. AML syncs organization/admin.
2. AML checks/updates user status when needed.
3. AML requests redirect URL to send user/admin into EDU.
4. EDU tracks progress and exposes statuses/logs via API.
