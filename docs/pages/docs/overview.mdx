# Project Overview

This page gives a high-level view of the EDU Immosurance integration and what each API area is used for.

## Integration Model

- **AML** is the client platform.
- **EDU** is the learning platform server.
- Communication is **server-to-server** over HTTPS.

## Base URL

```
https://edu.immosurance.net
```

## Authentication

API calls require an `api_key` query parameter.

The key is provided by the EDU team (not by Immosurance).

Example:

```
GET /api/immosurance/users/exists?immosurance_user_id=user-123&api_key=YOUR_EDU_API_KEY
```

### 2) User Lifecycle

### 3) Curriculum Management

### 4) Redirect Flows (Auto-Login)
