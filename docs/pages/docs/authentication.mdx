# Authentication

All API requests require an `api_key` query parameter.

## Authentication Model

The API key is issued and managed by the EDU team (not by Immosurance).

Include your key in each request:

```
?api_key=YOUR_EDU_API_KEY
```

**Example:**

```
GET https://edu.immosurance.net/api/immosurance/users/exists?immosurance_user_id=user-123&api_key=YOUR_EDU_API_KEY
```

## Security Notes

- Use **HTTPS only** — never send requests over HTTP
- Do not expose or log the API key
- Store the API key securely on your side
